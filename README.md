This repository needs to be deleted.

This work was moved to 18F too early, and was quickly moved to other spaces, owned by partners. Nothing in this repository needs to be kept, commemorated, or acknowledged in any way.

Or, [borrowing](https://www.damninteresting.com/this-place-is-not-a-place-of-honor/) from other work:

<blockquote>
This place is a message… and part of a system of messages… pay attention to it! Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.

This place is not a place of honor…no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here… nothing valued is here.
