This course is being developed in conjunction with colleagues at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The goal of this course is to support State Officers in tracking project health on an on-going basis. We do this by supporting SOs in asking questions in four broad categories:

1. **Assessing Health**. Is my state is on track for success?
2. **Questioning and Listening**. Is a state or vendor bullshitting me?
3. **Process and Action**. What steps can I take to improve project outcomes?
4. **Self and Community**. Am I confident in my work?

## About the word "Bullshit"

The word "bullshit" has a [long, rich history](https://www.etymonline.com/word/bull?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_18053). It's root, *bull*, comes potentially from the Old French (*bole*) or Icelandic (*bull*), generally meaning to deceive or trick, or in the Icelandic, "nonsense." In 1600's English, it might mean "a ludicrous blunder involving a contradiction in terms," with evidence of its use in the English language going back to the 14th century. 

In this course, "bullshit" is used as a technical term of art; we embrace the fact that people around the world have been calling bullshit for a very, very long time.

# About This Course

These materials are structured around a series of courses. Each course is made up of four lessons. Each lesson addresses one row of the [health rubric]({{ '/rubric/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). 

## Taking This Course

If you are taking this course, we recommend the following:

1. **Find some friends**. Do the course with at least one colleague. The course assumes you will have people to talk to about your learning on an ongoing basis.
2.  **Make time**. Each lesson requires 1-2 hours of reading, viewing, and reflection. Each lesson typically ends with one hour of conversation and reflection in community with your colleagues.
3.  **Reflect and Revisit**. Learning is not just the conveyance of information. Each lesson will introduce you to new ideas that may take time to understand and integrate into your professional practice. Don't be afraid to revisit the material from time-to-time to refresh yourself when you have questions.
4.  **Ask Questions**. Finally, remember you are learning in community with others. *Ask questions!* Talk with your colleagues about things you learn, questions you have, and (once you are beginning to apply these ideas) challenges that come up in your day-to-day work with states and vendors.

## Thank You

Learning is hard. It is to be respected and honored. If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please reach out to your colleagues at 18F and we'll be glad to support you in your work.
