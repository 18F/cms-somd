        - title: A Civic Technologist's Practice Guide
          author: Cyd Harrell 
          link: https://cydharrell.com/book/ 
          note: I’ve put every single thing I know about civic tech into this little book. It’s both an onboarding guide and a survival manual, and I hope it will be useful to the field. It outlines the types of projects, partnerships, and people that civic technologists encounter, and the methods we can use to make lasting change.

          author: Pat Kua
          note: "A Tech Lead is a software engineer responsible for leading a team and alignment of the technical direction. Providing a strong technical direction involves establishing a technical vision, resolving technical disagreements and managing the technical quality of team deliverables. Effective technical leadership ensures the team uses appropriate engineering practices (such as CD or automated testing), invests in continual improvements to tooling or technical debt, and that the system evolves to meet its changing needs and environment."

          author: Robbin Schuurman
          note: "The concept of a product roadmap however, is that it is a high-level, strategic plan, that describes the likely development of the product over the next period of time. The roadmap should support the products’ purpose and vision and it helps the Product Owners to keep their stakeholders aligned. The roadmap also makes it easier to coordinate the development of different products and it fosters transparency in order to manage customer expectations."

          note: |
            The challenge presented by traditional backlogs is they are flat and do not convey any notion of the end user’s journey. This makes it difficult to recognize if any gaps exist. Also, we can easily lose business context when trying to prioritize many user stories against each other. Story Maps were invented by Jeff Patton to help overcome those challenges. Patton’s process helps teams discover requirements from a user experience point of view.
