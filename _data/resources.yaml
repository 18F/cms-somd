        - title: A Civic Technologist's Practice Guide
          author: Cyd Harrell 
          link: https://cydharrell.com/book/ 
          note: I’ve put every single thing I know about civic tech into this little book. It’s both an onboarding guide and a survival manual, and I hope it will be useful to the field. It outlines the types of projects, partnerships, and people that civic technologists encounter, and the methods we can use to make lasting change.

          note: "A Tech Lead is a software engineer responsible for leading a team and alignment of the technical direction. Providing a strong technical direction involves establishing a technical vision, resolving technical disagreements and managing the technical quality of team deliverables. Effective technical leadership ensures the team uses appropriate engineering practices (such as CD or automated testing), invests in continual improvements to tooling or technical debt, and that the system evolves to meet its changing needs and environment."
