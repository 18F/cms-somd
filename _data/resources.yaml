        - title: A Civic Technologist's Practice Guide
          author: Cyd Harrell 
          link: https://cydharrell.com/book/ 
          note: I’ve put every single thing I know about civic tech into this little book. It’s both an onboarding guide and a survival manual, and I hope it will be useful to the field. It outlines the types of projects, partnerships, and people that civic technologists encounter, and the methods we can use to make lasting change.
