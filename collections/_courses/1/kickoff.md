    There's two ways you can get yourself pumped for this course. One is to listen to the intro material linked at right. You can do that here, or you can download the audio to a device of your choosing, and <b>go for a walk</b> while you listen.
    </div>
    <div class="grid-col-4">
        <audio
            controls
            src="{{ '/audio/kickoff.mp3' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
                Your browser does not support the
                <code>audio</code> element.
        </audio>
    </div>

Another way to get yourself into the course material would be to [read the syllabus](/syllabus/) while listening to some tunes you enjoy. (Or, in quiet. Whatever works best for you.)

## What This Course Covers

This course will cover four dimensions of the Health Tracker, one for each indicator.

The first indicator has to do with a project's **outcomes and orientation**. By *orientation*, we mean "which way is it pointing?" Having a "map" of sorts, and knowing how to keep an agile project pointed in the right direction is a challenge unto itself.

{% include rubric dimension="oo1.1" %}

The second indicator has to do with a **state's capacity** to manage the project on an ongoing basis. We'll focus on understanding the roles people play, and how those roles can (and cannot) contribute to project success.

{% include rubric dimension="sc1.1" %}

**Procurement flexibility** .... blah blah

{% include rubric dimension="pf1.1" %}

The final indicator we will talk about has to do with **iterative development**. 

{% include rubric dimension="id1.1" %}
