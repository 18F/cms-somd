## Goals Addressed

When it comes to monitoring the procurement of software and it's roadmap to completion, we really need to be focusing on assessing project health over a period of time, and listening to what is (and is *not*) being said by states and vendors alike. 

1. **Assessing Health**. Is my state is on track for success?
2. **Questioning and Listening**. Is a state or vendor bullshitting me?

## Objectives Addressed

In this course, we'll address two outcomes from the course syllabus:

1.  Compare state's estimates of progress to personal assessments and expectations.
2.  Rate contractual commitments to ongoing quality of process and product.

## Rubric Dimension

The rubric dimension covered by this course focuses on the *roadmap*, an abstract and truly *fluid* concept in software projects.
