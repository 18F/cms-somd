Course Two is not necessarily more complex or harder than Course One. It continues to work its way down the [rubric]({{ "/rubric/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), exploring the depth and breadth of project monitoring.

## What this course covers

This course will cover a row from each of the four primary indicators of the Health Tracker.

### Outcomes-orientation

The first primary indicator has to do with a project's **outcomes-orientation**. Part of the rubric that we'll investigate has to do with how teams measure progress, and whether they can demonstrate progress against those metrics and baselines.

### State capacity

The second indicator has to do with **state capacity** to manage the project on an ongoing basis. Here, we start to pick apart the roles that we might see within a well managed software project, and how those roles work together.

{% include rubric dimension="sc2.1" %}

### Procurement flexibility

**Procurement flexibility** is *critical*. It is where the money meets the work. The second course explores quality monitoring, which ties in neatly with other dimensions of the rubric explored in course two.

{% include rubric dimension="pf1.2" %}

### Iterative development

The final primary indicator we will talk about has to do with **iterative development**. Testing is a sometimes misunderstood and, yet, *critical* aspect of a long-lived software project. Specifically, this lesson will speak to the role that *actual users* play in the ongoing testing of a major software project.

## Pause to reflect

Once you have listened to the intro (or read through the syllabus), you can revisit the [scoring rubric]({{ '/rubric/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) that is used in the Health Tracker. (You don't *have* to re-read it, but if you want to, you can.) Then, pause to reflect on where you are confident at this moment, and where you have concerns. This is anonymous, and it will help us as we shape the course and the conversations we have over the coming weeks.
