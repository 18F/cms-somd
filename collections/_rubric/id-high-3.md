    What types of testing should a software project undergo and what does testing a project even mean? In this conversation, Princess Ojiaku and Heather Battaglia talk about what kinds of tests are important and when they should happen. This conversation includes a guest appearance by SHOUTYBOX, the screen reader that lost its way.

| Princess | Good morning, my name is Princess Ojiaku, and I’m an innovation specialist at 18F.  |

| Heather | screenreader will read back letters and words to you as you type them so you can tell if you need to go back and fix something. |
| Princess | I can see why you wouldn’t want it to shout out your password! |
| Heather | [Laughter] That was really concerning the first time I tried, and then realized, naturally, people have already thought about this. So, obviously it is really important to get the order of things correct, and to make sure that the screen reader is actually telling the user the correct thing about whatever they’ve loaded, or are interacting with. This can go spectacularly wrong, and you really want to catch that before it goes spectacularly wrong. |
| Matt | Oooh. This sounds like the voice of experience. |
| Heather | Well, the only way you get to be an expert at anything is by screwing it up a whole bunch of times. So, the most dramatic example I have of a time I caught this—in my own code! I will readily admit this is something I misarchitected from the beginning—we were creating this incredibly complex form, that was very interactive, had a lot of moving pieces, and depending on what the user input, different pieces of the form would appear or disappear. That’s a really challenging accessibility issue. When I went to test this with a screen reader, I realized that, through some fluke of the way we had built the app, it was shouting random things at the user when you loaded the page. So, you would load the page, and the app would shout random dollar amounts at you, and then would jump directly down to this group of yes/no input toggles, and would just yell “NO! NO! NO! NO!” about sixteen times, before it even told you what page you had landed on, or what form you were looking at. |

| Heather | That was *bad*. That was was not a good experience for anybody involved. We called this the *shoutybox* afterwards, because it was essentially a misapplication of ARIA alerts. The screenreader assumes whatever is in that alert is the most important thing for the user to know as soon as there is content there, and so it will interrupt everything else the user is doing and yell at them. And that was what we had done.  |
| Princess | I do want to ask one followup question from that. So, it sounds like, with this application, the alert system for the screenreader was just going haywire. It’s like something you built in saying “This is very important, read this out!,” but it was on overdrive. I’m wondering if testing… how would you test that? Is that something you just catch when it’s the first time you do it? Would you do it after it was released… which, obviously that would be a bad time to do it? [Laughter] How do you catch something like that, and when do you test? |
| Heather | So, I waited a *little bit too late* to test on this. We hadn’t released it (thankfully), but I needed to go back and rework a bunch of things I had done that were all based on the assumption that was going to work the way I expected it to… which it obviously **did not**. Generally, you want to be testing all the way through the development process. You want to start testing as early as makes sense. Ususally that means whenever you have a piece of code that is complete in-and-of-itself, you wnat to test that piece of code. It can be really hard to backfill those tests. If you wait until you’re ready to release an application before you write all of your tests, you’re going to find problems that you didn’t know existed. You’re going to have to fix them at the very end of the development cycle. And sometimes that can change assumptions that other pieces of the application are making. In my instance, I had to go rework three or four different input sets that had all assumed that this was going to be a system that worked. If I had tested this at the beginning when I had the first set done, then I could have written the other pieces in a way that wouldn’t require fixing afterwards. This is true of all testing, regardless of whether you are talking about testing migrations for your database, or testing the way your data interacts with your front-end inputs, or testing the way that it responsiveness works for mobile. The sooner you start testing things, the less you will make for yourself in the long run, and the more robust you will be able to make things when they are finished. |
| Princess | It sounds like, as soon as you have something, you need to go back and test it so that you won’t need to go back and repeat work. If you’re looking at testing something you want to test, or you’re looking at… maybe a state is doing it, and if they’re not testing at the beginning or continuously, then maybe that’s not the best way to do it. |
| Heather | There’s also… you will catch problems sooner. So, this can be really important when you’re talking about the way data flows between different pieces of your application. You might write something that interferes with the way that data flows all the way back to your data store without realizing it, because you’re not testing for it. You want to catch those problems as soon as possible, because those are going to change the assumptions that other pieces of code are making. They might break yet *other* pieces of code, and you won’t know that they’re broken, because you don’t have tests for them. So, even moreso than preventing future work for yourself, tests can prevent future bugs that you don’t know about, that can prevent your app from breaking for your audience, and you not knowing  that it’s broken. |
| Matt | Testing is… hmm… sounds like it’s bigger than people might think. And, it’s potentially easy, if a developer or vendor is working in a waterfall model, all of this testing is likely to be pushed to the end. And, from what you’re saying, there’s *no end* to the potential dangers, challenges, or problems that might cause a vendor to come back and say “we need another year on the contract before we can ship.” So, if we were to wrap this up a bit, my question as a State Officer should be… what kind of questions should I be asking? Are there questions around *who* is doing the testing? Questions around *when*? How would I wrap up these lessons learned in terms of both that “standing in the middle, looking at the front and back end,” in terms of the “many kinds of testings,” from unit testing, to integration testing, to accessibility and usability… any final thoughts? |
| Heather | All engineers should be responsible for testing the code that they submit. There are some ways that, as a non-technical product owner, you can watch for signs that testing is being done. One of those is by using code coverage tools. Code coverage tools will tell you how much of the codebase is currently “covered” by a test. For parts of your application can have automated tests written for them, code coverage tools can give you a signal of how much that codebase is covered by a test.  |
| Princess | Would that be like a percentage or something? Like, we’d say “100% of this is covered,” or 90%, or something like that? |
| Heather | Right. It would be a percentage of the lines of code in the codebase. You will almost never have 100% coverage, because there will always be things you can’t test, or you can’t write a test for in a way that a code coverage tool understands. When you’re working with a vendor, typically a quality assurance plan should have some sort of indication of the percentage you expect your code coverage to have. I believe most of the time we shoot for 90-some percent coverage, which is pretty high. But, code coverage tools aren’t enough in-and-of-themselves to tell you how many tests you have, and how much of your code covered… **but they won’t tell you if you have good tests**. This is where you really need someone working with you, on the state side, who has a depth of technical level to be able to assess the tests that are being written. And, that person can say “Yes! This is testing the right things!,” or “No! This isn’t testing the right things!” To make this a little bit less abstract, it’s absolutely possible for you to write a test that is self-sufficient. So, if you are testing data flows, and the tests that you write to check whether the front-end and back-end can speak to each-other is reliant on itself, then the dataflows might change in your application, and the test **will still pass** even though something is broken in your application. This is because the test is not robust enough to adapt to the changes that have actually occurred. By having a technical person working with you to assess tests and assess quality of tests, you can flag tests that really aren’t doing the job that you need them to do earlier. We normally refer to this kind of person as a “tech lead,” but as long as it is someone with some technical depth, you’re probably in good shape. |
| Princess | Thank you, that was awesome! Thank you so much for sharing your expertise with us and the State Officers. This will be really helpful, helping them to know what to look for when they’re talking to (hopefully) a tech lead, or someone about testing in their state’s projects. |
| Matt | Thank you. This was great. |
| Heather | Thank you so much. I’m really excited that I was able to join you for this. |
