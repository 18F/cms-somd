title: "Selecting Open Source"
dimension: id3.1
overview: |
    Open source software is software for which the code is freely available. That is, the "source" is "open." Systems built for the state are built using the taxpayer's dollars: they should have access to, and own, the software they paid for. This lesson is about how decisions are made in selecting software systems, and provides examples of free and open software that you might keep your eyes open for.
