overview: |
    Data is big business. Many contractors have learned that if they build a system that "locks in" the government, they not only "own" the data (potentially tying the government to them as a vendor in-perpetuity), but the data itself becomes a valuable commodity to be resold on the open market. Neither of these outcomes (necessarily) serves the people.
