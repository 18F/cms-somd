| Princess | Good morning, my name is Princess Ojiaku, and Iâ€™m an innovation specialist at 18F. Today we're going to be talking about vendor contracts and budgets and how they can go right or maybe even wrong. I've asked my colleage, Carrie Fehrer, to share her experience with us so we know what we can look for when we're asking states about their vendors. So Carrie, can you tell us a little bit about what you do at 18F and your background and who you are? |
| Carrie | Sure! Hello, my name is Carrie Fehrer and I've been at 18F for almost 2 years now. and I'm an account manager at 18F. And that basically means I am the liason for our partners, so I do a lot of business development initally with our partners to bring them on board. And I work with with them really closely to work on scope of work and get our agreements going and set the teams up and do some staffing for the teams. And make sure that even during the projects that the internal team health of 18F is healthy and that the partner team health is healthy and that if we do an assisted aquistion (or acq consulting/aquistion consulting) that all the different internal teams of the vendors and all of that is really healthy. So I'm not necessarily part of the internal team to build something but I'm part of the team that works with each separate team to make sure team health is really good.

Before that, I worked at CMS in Medicaid for 8 years. So I've actually been a federal employee for 10 years as of December 2nd. SO I'm really proud of that -- I love being a federal employee. I feel like I can make a lot of connections between the role of a state officer and the role of an account managet at 18F. So that's why I cwas really excited to do this. There's a lot of comparison between what I do as an account manager and what someone would do as a state officer as far as partnernships and bringing people along where they need to be to really make some significant changes and difference in how they do their work, to really see value. I feel like my experience both at Medicaid and in having managed some state officers for awhile as the deputy director for some time and then also being an account manager for a couple of years now -- y'know I can draw on some of those experiences. So hopefully some of that can come out today. (2:29) |
| Princess |  Yeah, I can see the parallels between managing accounts -- even though it's not called "account manager" you're almost doing the same thing -- you're looking at state contracts and kind of approving or denying those. So let's start with the vendor-state relationship. If you're trying to find out how something's going with a vendor-state relationship what should you do? What kinds of things should you look for and how do you probe at that?|
| Carrie | Right. So as with any relationship, you need to form trust first. So a state, as with anyone, isn't going to give you all of the information and give you what's behind that curtain until you build that trust and earn the right to hear their story. So you will know some information based on the documents you have on hand as a state officer. Obviously you will know who the vendor is so that will give you some indication -- is it a small vendor or a large vendor? You're going to know how long they've been with that vendor, you're going to know the size -- like how much money they've spent on that vendor. Those will give you some indications, which we'll talk about later, which could be some red or green flags. But to really know how the relationship is, you need to build a relationship, as a state officer, with the state to know is it a healthy relationship? is it a partnership? Or does the vendor sort of own the state in the sense of -- if you ask the state a question and the state defers to the vendor for the answer -- does the state not really own their system, does the state not really own their mission, does the state not really own their vision for where they're going and their prioritization, or their data for that matter. So its improatnt for when a state officer is talking to their state that they really understand what that dynamic is between the state and their vendor or their vendors, obviously they could have multiple vendors. So you wanna understand, is it a healthy partnership? Is the vendor brining them along, or is the state bringing them alog, or is it very much that they're working together on this? But the state should be the leader. If that's not the case, that could be a red flag. But understanding that relationship is really the first step in this because most state officers are going to inherit where the state already is with a vendor. it's not going to be new. So the state officier is going to get the state and the relationship's already going to be there, and so understanding what that is is really important. (5 min) |
