*This lesson explores the highest priority dimension of the State Capacity indicator of the health tracking rubric.*

{% include rubric dimension="sc1.1" %}

Software projects are complex, creative projects that involve the orchestration of complex systems of hardware and software. The objective of this module is to lay foundations regarding the kinds of skills and capacities states should have for managing these projects. This will help you, as an SO, better support and evaluate the projects you are responsible for.

## Reflection: Managing Projects (20m, solo)

You've been managing projects in many contexts. Perhaps you tackle DIY projects, big or small, at home. Maybe you wrangle food for your household, doing shopping and food prep. At work, you're always wrangling some project or other, to say nothing of the work you do with states.

Make notes -- bullets, paragraphs, whatever works for you -- about all the moving pieces you need to keep track of when you're managing a project. Perhaps this looks different for different kinds of projects, so feel free to see how the list does (or does not) change if you consider 2-3 different projects you've worked on.

After you identify the things you keep track of, make a second list. This second list should be the habits and skills you need to succeed in managing projects. 

## Reading: Tech and Project Leads (30m, solo)

When it comes to software projects, there are two roles you're likely to see in management positions: the <b>tech lead</b> and <b>product manager</b>, or <b>PM</b>. An important part of understanding project health is going to involve understanding these people, how they work with their teams, and how well they do that. To get started, lets start with a short video or two to set some context:

Then, for some depth, we'll do some reading.

## Writing: Who's On Your Projects? (10m, solo)

While this content is fresh, pick (at least) two people you work with on your projects who you think fit these roles. In your notebook, identify the qualities you observe in them and their work that you think exemplifies good (technical, product) management. Then, make note of the things that are sources of concern for you, given what you've read.

Jot down a few bullets for each. We're not diving deep here; the goal is to reflect some of the learning you've just done back into your own project work.



## Discussion: Team Function (1h, group)

With a colleague, find a time to have some conversation about your projects. 

1. {% include countdowntimer id="checkin" minutes=5 %} **Check in**. First, check in with each-other. How are you all doing? Take a moment to share something positive from the week, either at work or at home.
2. {% include countdowntimer id="collect" minutes=3 %} **Collect Thoughts**. In the next step, you're going to report out brief answers to each of the questions below. So, lets collect our thoughts. Read the questions below, and make a note or two about each, so that you'll be ready to speak clearly and briefly about each.
3. {% include countdowntimer id="circle" minutes=20 %} **Question Circle**. For each of the five questions below, take 2m each to answer these questions round-robin style. That is, take question 1, and have each person report out for 1-2m (no more! be brief!). Then, move on to question 2, and so on.
4. {% include countdowntimer id="contrast" minutes=20 %} **Compare and Contrast**. You've not heard from each-other regarding each-other's projects. What resonated as familiar or similar? What sounds different? Did anything surface that was particularly challenging or problematic? You might want to take a few minutes as a group and dig into those challenging spaces. Try not to spend more than 5-8 minutes per challenge.
5. {% include countdowntimer id="redgreen" minutes=5 %} **Red / Green**. Finally, go back through with your partner and "flag" things as "red light," "yellow light," "green light." That is, given your knowledge so far, identify things you think are good ("green light"), things that might be cause for concern or to pay more attention to ("yellow light"), and those aspects of your teams that you think are going to be a space of focus and potential intervention in the future ("red light"). We'll come back to those "red light" concerns in future modules.
