# {{ page.title }}

The first course touches on the highest priority dimension of each indicator in the [health tracking rubric](/rubric/).

The content of this first course was guided by four broad, guiding questions:

1. **Assessing Health**. Is my state is on track for success?
2. **Questioning and Listening**. Is a state or vendor bullshitting me?
3. **Process and Action**. What steps can I take to improve project outcomes?
4. **Self and Community**. Am I confident in my work?

This last module is a chance to reflect and report out. **Reflection is a critical part of the learning process**.

## Things I Learned (30m, solo)

Divide a page in your notebook into four sections. Title each section with one of the goals above ("Assessing Health," "Questioning and Listening," etc.).

Take a half hour and go back through your notebook from this course sequence. As you do, make notes on this partitioned page about the things you learned or reflected on that you think advanced you in terms of your ability to (for example) question and listening states and vendors. What things did we read, view, and discuss that helped you advance your ability to ask (and assess) whether you are being bullshitted?

## Discuss (1h, group)

In this discussion, one of you should agree to take notes. Again, divide a page into four categories as above. If you're uncertain as to who should take notes, choose the person whose birthday is in or closest to October.

With your learning cohort, come back together to discuss your lessons learned. What was most surprising? What did you find most valuable? What practices or next steps do you hope to take as a state officer based on the material you've learned and discussed as a group?

As you're having this conversation, attempt to distill some of your learning down. If you could only share one thing with your colleagues from each dimension, what would it be? 

After you have captured these four lessons learned, go back through the list as a group. To each "lesson learned," attach an action. That is, what behavior, process, question, or next step can you take in your practice as a state officer that puts that lesson learned into practice?

When you're done, you'll have four "lessons learned" and four actionable "next steps" you can take. The note taker should write this up in a short document (or slide deck) that is able to be shared with a broader audience.

## Report Out (?m, team)

To celebrate the completion of the first course, find time in a team huddle to report out on this first course. The core of your presentation should be the four lessons learned, and the actionable next steps. It is likely that you won't have much time (because, sadly, we're all busy), but this is an opportunity for your colleagues to lift you up for having undertaken this learning, and a chance for you to share out how you hope to advance and grow as a state officer.

Congratulations. You've completed course one.
